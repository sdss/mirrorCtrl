<h1><a href="index.html">Mirror Controller</a> Version History</h1>

<h3>1.0.3+ 2014-11-06</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Corrected some issues for SDSS: the mirror controller script and makeMirCtrlStartupScript both needed a bit of work.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.3 2014-10-31</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: the state keyword did not have user command info associated with it.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2 2014-10-30</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The state keyword now shows Disconnected if the Galil is not connected.
    <li>The state keyword now is output with message code "w" unless the state is Done or Moving.
    <li>Bug fix: predicted durations from the Galil set the time limit of the user command instead of the device command; this fix should make long moves more robust.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1 2014-10-28</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed remaining use of environment variable TWISTED_LOG_DIR.
    <li>Removed one explicit use of path "/Users/csayres".
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0 2014-10-09</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Mirror name now reported to the user when the user connects to the mirror controller.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.5 2014-10-09</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed the reset command.
    <li>Renamed device to "galil". Original name was that of the mirror.  This is mainly relavent for commanding (dis)connection of devices, eg: "connDev galil".
</ul>

<h3>0.9.4 2014-10-08</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The command "stop" is now deprecated; use "init" instead. "stop is still an alias for "init".
    <li>The "init" command command now connects the Galil, if not already connected.
    <li>Fixed command collisions by moving command queue into Galil device object.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.3 2014-09-24</h3>

<p>Modernized exception catching syntax.

<h3>0.9.2 2014-08-29</h3>

<p>Improved the documentation main page, including moving the installation instructions to that page.

<h3>0.9.1 2014-08-19</h3>

<p>The first version with version history.
