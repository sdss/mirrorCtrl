<h1><a href="index.html">Mirror Controller</a> Version History</h1>

<h3>1.0.10 2015-04-14</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Bug fix: large actuator errors will no longer produce RuntimeError.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.8 2015-02-25</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Actuators must be specifed for home command (previously defaulted to all).
</ul>

<h3>1.0.7 2015-02-05</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Fixed unit test failure caused by excessively stringent comparison of floats after a fitting routine.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.6 2015-01-23</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Fixed unit test failure caused by excessively stringent comparison of floats after a fitting routine.
</ul>

<h3>Documentation update 2015-01-13</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added a software license (BSD-3 in doc/license.txt) and a readme file (ReadMe.md).
</ul>

<h3>1.0.5 2015-01-07</h3>

<ul>
    <li>SDSS 2.5m Primary: special pure piston move commands now finish cleanly.
    <li>SDSS 2.5m Secondary: status is now output after peizo moves finish, a requirement for STUI to correctly display the move as Done.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.4 2014-11-20</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The "galil" breakthrough command now echoes all replies. Note that this means commands such as "galil XQ#SHOWPAR" will produce a lot of duplicated information: the raw output and the keywords produced by parsing that raw text.
    <li>Improved SDSS 2.5m support, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Modifying Prim25mMirrorCtrl to use new GalilDevice25mPrim, a device that never introduces tilt for pure changes in focus.
        <li>Finishing the prim25m.py and sec25m.py startup scripts.
        <li>Adding SDSS support to makeMirCtrlStartupScript.py
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>1.0.3 2014-10-31</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: the state keyword did not have user command info associated with it.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2 2014-10-30</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The state keyword now shows Disconnected if the Galil is not connected.
    <li>The state keyword now is output with message code "w" unless the state is Done or Moving.
    <li>Bug fix: predicted durations from the Galil set the time limit of the user command instead of the device command; this fix should make long moves more robust.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1 2014-10-28</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed remaining use of environment variable TWISTED_LOG_DIR.
    <li>Removed one explicit use of path "/Users/csayres".
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0 2014-10-09</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Mirror name now reported to the user when the user connects to the mirror controller.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.5 2014-10-09</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed the reset command.
    <li>Renamed device to "galil". Original name was that of the mirror.  This is mainly relavent for commanding (dis)connection of devices, eg: "connDev galil".
</ul>

<h3>0.9.4 2014-10-08</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The command "stop" is now deprecated; use "init" instead. "stop is still an alias for "init".
    <li>The "init" command command now connects the Galil, if not already connected.
    <li>Fixed command collisions by moving command queue into Galil device object.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.3 2014-09-24</h3>

<p>Modernized exception catching syntax.

<h3>0.9.2 2014-08-29</h3>

<p>Improved the documentation main page, including moving the installation instructions to that page.

<p>The first version with version history.
